# LearnStocks-Webapp
A work in progress, this will be an open-source streamlit where economic theory meets software implementation. I have built two indicator calculators and a page where users can create custome neural-networks and run them straight on the AWS server without any code and are represented with the results.

An interactive web-app where users can visualize real-time stock indicators (SMA and MACD) on any stock's historic data, and createtheir own custom neural-networks to train the model for future price prediction and visualize the results as well as grade theperformance without any code.

The neural-network for prediction backend is implemented using Keras LSTMs and Dense layers which the user can customize usingthe interface
