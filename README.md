# LearnStocks-Webapp
A work in progress, this will be an open-source streamlit where economic theory meets software implementation. I have built two indicator calculators and a page where users can create custome neural-networks and run them straight on the AWS server without any code and are represented with the results.
TODO:
- About us site
- Add more categories
- Add output of Tensorflow/keras into the front-end and a timer so the user knows how long the model needs to fit.
- Improve structure
= Implement threads so keras could fit while the user does something else.
